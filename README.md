# WavePy3

*Version*: 0.0.1

WavePy3 is an update to the original WavePy package by Beck et. al.
We have translated the code to python 3 and improved the user
friendliness decreasing the amount of code necessary to implement a
properly sampled wave optics simulation. 

## Changes

* Updated to Python 3
* Packaged code to increase user friendliness
 * Atmos
 * propagation
 * tests & examples
 
## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the original developers of WavePy J. Beck, C.
Beckins, and J. P. Bos. without their work this would not have been
possible. Special thanks to Greg Badura, Cody Fernandez, and John
Stewart. Without their most recent publication and presentation at SPIE
conference I would not have known about this package and would not have
been inspired to attempt to carry on the work of open sourcing wave
optics simulations.
